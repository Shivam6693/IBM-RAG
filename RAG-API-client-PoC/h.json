Point of Sale devices, scanners, barcode readers, printers, and mobile computers, for example, all operate on Wireless LANs (WLAN) that serve as the lifeblood of retail operations. Given the importance of WLANs, there are two types of requirements specifically outlined for the PCI DSS compliance of wireless networks. These include:\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nGenerally applicable wireless These are requirements that apply even when the wireless network is not in scope of the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). They include strong network segmentation to protect the CDE network and security against attacks from rogue or unknown wireless Access Points and clients.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSecuring wireless in a CDE These are requirements mandated for systems that transmit payment card information over wireless and wired technology. In addition to generally applicable wireless requirements, they impose additional security requirements for changing default passwords and configurations, using strong encryption and authentication, regular updating of the system with compliant software, and monitoring access.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThis paper addresses how the Mist Learning WLAN delivers a robust PCI-compliant solution.\\n\\u00a0\\nPCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC)\\nJuniper Mist solution has been assessed by an independent PCI DSS security assessor to meet PCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC).\\n\\u00a0\\nCloud Security\\nThe Mist cloud is outside the CDE environment as it does not carry any wireless packet data. Regardless, Mist takes additional measures to ensure the highest level of security in the Mist cloud to ensure confidentiality, processing integrity, and availability.\\u00a0\\u00a0 For example:\\n\\nMist uses a SOC2 Type 2 / ISO 27001 / PCI cloud data\\nMaintains an information security policy.\\nUser access is highly\\nUse of network application firewalls / access control lists.\\nUse of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Protection System (IPS).\\nIndustry standard encryption is utilized at various levels.\\nAny information stored in the cloud is obfuscated with an organization-specific\\nSecurity is integrated with development cycles, and pen tests are performed to detect vulnerabilities at the network and application\\nPerform regularly scheduled internal and external vulnerability scans.\\nImplement annual security awareness training for all in-scope employees.\\nPerform an annual risk assessment of the in-scope business environment.\\nHave in place incident response plan.\\nAnnual PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC) by independent PCI DSS security assessor\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nNetwork Segmentation\\nAll the following schemas can be implemented in a Mist environment to ensure network segmentation:\\n\\u00a0\\nPhysical Segmentation: One way to achieve network segmentation is to connect the wireless Access Points on a wired network that is physically separate from the CDE network. This would imply having an overlay wired and wireless infrastructure that does not have any intersection with the wired network for the CDE environment. In this scheme, there is no firewall or internet connection that is shared between the CDE and non-CDE networks.\\n\\u00a0\\nVLAN based logical segmentation: It is common to use Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment the networks into logical subnets. While it is possible to achieve logical segmentation by having the wireless network and the CDE in different VLANs, this methodology is not considered a safe and secure way to protect the network, without adequate access control policies between VLANs.\\nFirewall separation: If the wireless LAN is connected to the CDE, instituting a Firewall between the Wireless network and the CDE network is an acceptable form of segmentation that conforms to PCI DSS 3.2.1 requirements.\\nSoftware defined policy engine. Mist\\u2019s integrated WxLAN policy engine can be used to isolate any wireless traffic into the CDE environment. Mist delivers a powerful platform when it comes to creating policies for role, user, application, and resource-based access on the network via its inline policy engine \\u2013 WxLAN. The Mist wireless infrastructure allows policies to be enforced on any wired network with access to the LAN blocked for all WLANs configured in the system.\\nProtect Network from External Attacks\\nTo ensure the wireless network is compliant with the generally applicable requirements for PCI DSS, retailers need to pay special attention to the following:\\n\\nRogue Devices: These are accidental or malicious Access Points on the wired network that can be used to violate internal networks with access to all network resources.\\nHoneypot devices: these are accidental or malicious Access Points that masquerade as sanctioned Access Points beaconing a retailer\\u2019s Access\\nNon-compliant and unsanctioned Access Points: These range for Access Points that may be sanctioned Access Points but out of compliance running old firmware without critical security Similarly, these may also include Access Points that are neighbors as well as those causing inadvertent interference to the wireless operations inside the four walls of a retail store or warehouse.\\n\\nTwo activities are required for handling these external devices, often referred to as Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention (WIDS/ WIPS):\\n\\nMonitor the RF environment to find and analyze the existence of\\nIsolate any Wi-Fi Access Points not used to transmit or receive cardholder\\n\\nTraditionally there have been several ways in which WLAN vendors have addressed the above requirements for WIDS/WIPS compliance:\\n\\nPart time In this mode, Access Points when not serving clients scan the spectrum for rogue devices. This is almost akin to having a security solution that only works some of the time \\u2013 not 24\\u00d77.\\nDedicated Access Points provide 24\\u00d77 security monitoring of the wireless While this does protect the network all the time, it explodes the deployment cost for additional APs with associated installation cost of PoE cable runs to the IDF/MDF to power up the sensors.\\nSome vendors use dual-banded radios in Access Points and steal a radio within an Access Point for sensor implementation leading to nightmares in channel planning and insufficient coverage for clients in the\\nSome vendors, while offering a tri-radio Access Point solution with a dedicated third radio, deploy a complete overlay monitoring solutions orthogonal to the rest of the Wireless infrastructure and Controller solution with isolated islands of data sources, databases, visualization and even separate controls for radio configuration, control, and provisioning.\\n\\nThe Mist Access Points provide continuous 24\\u00d77 scanning of the spectrum alongside 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and 6Ghz client access. This allows Mist to continually scan the spectrum for rogues, honeypots, interferers and for other anomalies such as unsuccessful connection attempts at a site (which may be a source for a DDOS attack).\\nIn addition, unlike traditional vendors, the Mist platform maintains a state machine and a baseline on key metrics for every physical device (Access Point, clients) and logical entity (location, site, site-groups) that complements flow information and a rich elastic cloud data store. Mist\\u2019s AI powered infrastructure identifies unusual activity at every level of the network and this way the Mist platform can detect existing and zero-day threats. In addition, Mist\\u2019s location technology can be used to accurately locate accidental or malicious rogue devices and\\nprovide location-based access to resources. Mist\\u2019s Machine Learning framework can be extended to behavioral analytics whereby client device capabilities can be checked against the \\u201cnormal\\u201d baseline and alerts generated when key postures change (e.g. a 4\\u00d74 client device appears as a 2\\u00d72 device or a client device sanctioned for a California location appears to access the network from New York).\\n\\u00a0\\nSecuring Wireless in the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)\\nAs mentioned above, the second set of requirements applies to wireless devices on the same network where credit card data is handled. Mist allows you to conduct a PCI scan for the VLAN\\u2019s and Wireless LAN\\u2019s in scope, and helps you remediate both the vulnerabilities on the wireless network and enforce policies on the wireless management system.\\n\\u00a0\\nThe following is how Mist addresses the main requirements for these \\u201cin scope\\u201d wireless networks to be PCI DSS compliant:\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nPCI DSS REQUIREMENTS V3.1 FOR WIRELESS\\nMIST CONFORMS\\nMIST VALUE PROPOSITION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.1.2 Current network diagram that identifies all connections between the cardholder data environment and other networks, including any wireless networks.\\n\\u221a\\nMist\\u2019s PCI scan report identifies the list of wireless SSIDs and Access Points that connect with the CDE.\\n\\n\\n2.1.1 For wireless environments connected to the cardholder data environment or transmitting cardholder data, change ALL wireless vendor defaults at installation, including but not limited to default wireless encryption keys, passwords, and SNMP community strings.\\n\\u221a\\nMist does not have default passwords, encryption keys or SNMP community strings.\\n\\n\\n2.4 Maintain an inventory of system components that are in scope for PCI DSS. Maintain an inventory of system components that are in scope for PCI DSS.\\n\\u221a\\nMist provides a list of wireless networks and Access Points that are in scope of PCI DSS.\\n\\n\\n4.1.1 Ensure wireless networks transmitting cardholder data or connected to the cardholder data environment, use industry best practices to implement strong encryption for authentication and transmission.\\n\\u221a\\nMist supports strong encryption standards, including WPA2-PSK, and WPA2-Enterprise with AES encryption. As part of its PCI scan report, Mist calls out any weak encryption used on SSID in scope of the CDE.\\n\\n\\n6.2 Ensure that all system components and software are protected from known vulnerabilities by installing applicable vendor-supplied security patches. Install critical security patches within one month of release.\\nNote: Critical security patches should be identified according to the risk ranking process defined in Requirement 6.1.\\n\\u221a\\nMist makes available the latest released firmware that includes any critical fix required for the integrity of the wireless network. Mist identifies any Access Point that has not yet been upgraded to the latest firmware.\\n\\n\\n7.1 Limit access to system components and cardholder data to only those individuals whose job requires such access.\\n\\u221a\\nWireless network access is restricted to authorized administrators. All authorized administrators are listed on the Mist PCI scan report.\\n\\n\\n7.2 Establish an access control system(s) for systems components that restricts access based on a user\\u2019s need to know and is set to \\u201cdeny all\\u201d unless specifically allowed.\\n\\u221a\\nMist Network Administrators are assigned roles with limited scope of access. Default administrator role is Observer (View-only).\\n\\n\\n8.1.1 Assign all users a unique ID before allowing them to access system components or cardholder data.\\n\\u221a\\nMist\\u2019s PCI scan report identifies the list of wireless SSIDs and Access Points that connect with the CDE.\\n\\n\\n8.2 In addition to assigning a unique ID, ensure proper user- authentication management for non-consumer users and administrators on all system components by employing at least one of the following methods to authenticate all users:\\n\\u2022\\u00a0 Something you know, such as a password or passphrase\\n\\u2022\\u00a0 Something you have, such as a token device or smart card\\n\\u2022\\u00a0 Something you are, such as a biometric\\n\\u221a\\nAll Mist administrators are authenticated using either complex passwords or Two-factor authentication (2FA)..\\n\\n\\n9.1.3 Restrict physical access to wireless access points, gateways, handheld devices, networking/communications hardware, and telecommunication lines.\\n\\u221a\\nMist Access Points can be made physically secure with the help of screws and brackets available as part of the access point kit. Additional physical security is supported with the Kensington lock slot on the Access Point.\\n\\n\\n10.1 Implement audit trails to link all access to system components to each individual user.\\n\\u221a\\nAll system access, updates and configuration changes are tracked in an audit log.\\n\\n\\n10.5.4 Write logs for external-facing technologies onto a secure, centralized, internal log server or media device.\\n\\u221a\\nAll event logs are stored in centralized servers in the Mist cloud platform hosted in a SOC 2 Type 2 Data Center.\\n\\n\\n11.1 Implement processes to test for the presence of wireless access points (802.11), and detect and identify all authorized and unauthorized wireless access points on a quarterly basis.\\n\\u00a0\\nNote: Methods that may be used in the process include but are not limited to wireless network scans, physical/logical inspections of system components and infrastructure, network access control (NAC), or wireless IDS/IPS. Whichever methods are used, they must be sufficient to detect and identify both authorized and unauthorized devices.\\n\\u221a\\nMist WIDS/WIPS allows detection of authorized and unauthorized access points on the network, eliminating the need for manually intensive wireless scans. Specifically, rogue Access Point detection and containment protects the CDE network from being compromised.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nConclusion\\nAs organizations rely more on wireless networks as a key enabler for business services, PCI DSS requires careful attention to WLAN security.\\nFortunately, Mist has you covered. By protecting wireless networks from external attack and ensuring data transferred on CDE networks is always secure, the Mist Learning WLAN is a safe choice for mission critical wireless networks in PCI environments. The key difference in the Mist architecture is how the workflows have been streamlined to enable a cohesive experience for network IT, Security Operations Teams, Marketing, and other lines of business. With Mist, access layer connectivity and associated applications is now all about delivering a comprehensive, amazing, and secure experience. []",

By protecting wireless networks from external attack and ensuring data transferred on CDE networks is always secure, the Mist Learning WLAN is a safe choice for mission critical wireless networks in PCI environments. The key difference in the Mist architecture is how the workflows have been streamlined to enable a cohesive experience for network IT, Security Operations Teams, Marketing, and other lines of business. With Mist, access layer connectivity and associated applications is now all about delivering a comprehensive, amazing, and secure experience.",

By providing consistent and holistic security policies and best practices, PCI DSS\\n      enables security personnel and network administrators to effectively thwart various threats to\\n      payment data. PCI DSS 3.2.1 went into effect for assessments in May 2018.\\nThe network is a critical cornerstone of PCI DSS compliance as it is the primary channel for\\n      transmitting payment data. PCI DSS requirements are designed to ensure that network security\\n      operations and practices eliminate or minimize known risks. Plus, they ensure that the\\n      organization defines traceable well-structured policies, procedures, and practices that can be\\n      audited.\\nThe wireless network in particular is especially important to retail environments as business\\n      operations and digital engagement technologies rely upon mobile connectivity. Point of Sale\\n      devices, scanners, barcode readers, printers, and mobile computers, for example, all operate\\n      on Wireless LANs (WLAN) that serve as the lifeblood of retail operations. Given the importance\\n      of WLANs, there are two types of requirements specifically outlined for the PCI DSS compliance\\n      of wireless networks. These include:\\nGenerally applicable wireless\\nThese are requirements that apply even when the\\n        wireless network is not in scope of the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). They include\\n        strong network segmentation to protect the CDE network and security against attacks from\\n        rogue or unknown wireless Access Points (APs) and clients.\\nSecuring wireless in a CDE\\nThese are requirements mandated for systems that\\n        transmit payment card information over wireless and wired technology. In addition to\\n        generally applicable wireless requirements, they impose additional security requirements for\\n        changing default passwords and configurations, using strong encryption and authentication,\\n        regular updating of the system with compliant software, and monitoring access.\\nPCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC)\\nJuniper Mist solution has been assessed by an independent PCI DSS security assessor to meet\\n      PCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC).\\nCloud Security\\nThe Mist cloud is outside the CDE environment as it does not carry any wireless packet data.\\n      Regardless, Mist takes additional measures to ensure the highest level of security in the Mist\\n      cloud to ensure confidentiality, processing integrity, and availability. For example:\\nMist uses a SOC2 Type 2 / ISO 27001 / PCI cloud data\\nMaintains an information security policy.\\nUser access is highly\\nUse of network application firewalls / access control lists.\\nUse of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Protection System (IPS).\\nIndustry standard encryption is utilized at various levels.\\nAny information stored in the cloud is obfuscated with an organization-specific\\nSecurity is integrated with development cycles, and pen tests are performed to detect\\n        vulnerabilities at the network and application\\nPerform regularly scheduled internal and external vulnerability scans.\\nImplement annual security awareness training for all in-scope employees.\\nPerform an annual risk assessment of the in-scope business environment.\\nHave in place incident response plan.\\nAnnual PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC) by independent PCI DSS security\\n        assessor\\nNetwork Segmentation\\nThe following schemas can be implemented in a Mist environment to\\n      ensure network segmentation:\\nPhysical Segmentation:\\nOne way to achieve network segmentation is to connect the\\n      wireless APs on a wired network that is physically separate from the CDE network. This would\\n      imply having an overlay wired and wireless infrastructure that does not have any intersection\\n      with the wired network for the CDE environment. In this scheme, there is no firewall or\\n      internet connection that is shared between the CDE and non-CDE networks.\\nVLAN based logical segmentation:\\nIt is common to use Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment\\n      the networks into logical subnets. While it is possible to achieve logical segmentation by\\n      having the wireless network and the CDE in different VLANs, this methodology is not considered\\n      a safe and secure way to protect the network, without adequate access control policies between\\n      VLANs.\\nFirewall separation:\\nIf the wireless LAN is connected to the CDE, instituting a\\n      Firewall between the Wireless network and the CDE network is an acceptable form of\\n      segmentation that conforms to PCI DSS 3.2.1 requirements.\\nSoftware defined policy engine.\\nMist\\u2019s integrated WxLAN policy engine can be used to\\n      isolate any wireless traffic into the CDE environment. Mist delivers a powerful platform when\\n      it comes to creating policies for role, user, application, and resource-based access on the\\n      network via its inline policy engine \\u2013 WxLAN. The Mist wireless infrastructure allows policies\\n      to be enforced on any wired network with access to the LAN blocked for all WLANs configured in\\n      the system.\\nProtect Network from External Attacks\\nTo ensure the wireless network is compliant with the generally applicable requirements for\\n      PCI DSS, retailers need to pay special attention to the following:\\nRogue Devices: These are accidental or malicious AP on the wired network that can be used\\n        to violate internal networks with access to all network resources.\\nHoneypot devices: these are accidental or malicious AP that masquerade as sanctioned AP\\n        sending the retailer\\u2019s AP beacon.\\nNon-compliant and unsanctioned APs: These range for APs that may be sanctioned APs but out\\n        of compliance running old firmware without critical security Similarly, these may also\\n        include APs that are neighbors as well as those causing inadvertent interference to the\\n        wireless operations inside the four walls of a retail store or warehouse.\\nTwo activities are required for handling these external devices, often referred to as\\n      Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention (WIDS/ WIPS):\\nMonitor the RF environment to find and analyze the existence of\\nIsolate any Wi-Fi APs not used to transmit or receive cardholder\\nTraditionally there have been several ways in which WLAN vendors have addressed the above\\n      requirements for WIDS/WIPS compliance:\\nPart-time\\nIn this mode, APs when not serving clients scan the spectrum for rogue\\n        devices.

This allows Mist to continually scan the spectrum for rogues, honeypots,\\n      interference, and for anomalies such as unsuccessful connection attempts at a site (which may\\n      be a source for a DDOS attack).\\nIn addition, unlike traditional vendors, the Mist platform maintains a state machine and a\\n      baseline on key metrics for every physical device (AP, clients) and logical entity (location,\\n      site, site-groups) that complements flow information and a rich elastic cloud data store.\\n      Mist\\u2019s AI powered infrastructure identifies unusual activity at every level of the network and\\n      this way the Mist platform can detect existing and zero-day threats. In addition, Mist\\u2019s\\n      location technology can be used to accurately locate accidental or malicious rogue devices\\n      and\\nprovide location-based access to resources. Mist\\u2019s Machine Learning framework can be extended\\n      to behavioral analytics whereby client device capabilities can be checked against the \\u201cnormal\\u201d\\n      baseline and alerts generated when key postures change (e.g. a 4\\u00d74 client device appears as a\\n      2\\u00d72 device or a client device sanctioned for a California location appears to access the\\n      network from New York).\\nSecuring Wireless in the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)\\nAs mentioned above, the second set of requirements applies to wireless devices on the same\\n      network where credit card data is handled. Mist allows you to conduct a PCI scan for the VLANs\\n      and Wireless LANs in scope, and helps you remediate both the vulnerabilities on the wireless\\n      network and enforce policies on the wireless management system.\\nThe following is how Mist addresses the main requirements for these \\u201cin scope\\u201d wireless\\n      networks to be PCI DSS compliant:\\nConclusion\\nAs organizations rely more on wireless networks as a key enabler for business services, PCI\\n      DSS requires careful attention to WLAN security.\\nFortunately, Mist has you covered. By protecting wireless networks from external attack and\\n      ensuring data transferred on CDE networks is always secure, the Mist Learning WLAN is a safe\\n      choice for mission critical wireless networks in PCI environments. The key difference in the\\n      Mist architecture is how the workflows have been streamlined to enable a cohesive experience\\n      for network IT, Security Operations Teams, Marketing, and other lines of business.

By providing consistent and holistic security policies and best practices, PCI DSS\\n      enables security personnel and network administrators to effectively thwart various threats to\\n      payment data. PCI DSS 3.2.1 went into effect for assessments in May 2018.\\nThe network is a critical cornerstone of PCI DSS compliance as it is the primary channel for\\n      transmitting payment data. PCI DSS requirements are designed to ensure that network security\\n      operations and practices eliminate or minimize known risks. Plus, they ensure that the\\n      organization defines traceable well-structured policies, procedures, and practices that can be\\n      audited.\\nThe wireless network in particular is especially important to retail environments as business\\n      operations and digital engagement technologies rely upon mobile connectivity. Point of Sale\\n      devices, scanners, barcode readers, printers, and mobile computers, for example, all operate\\n      on Wireless LANs (WLAN) that serve as the lifeblood of retail operations. Given the importance\\n      of WLANs, there are two types of requirements specifically outlined for the PCI DSS compliance\\n      of wireless networks. These include:\\nGenerally applicable wireless\\nThese are requirements that apply even when the\\n        wireless network is not in scope of the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). They include\\n        strong network segmentation to protect the CDE network and security against attacks from\\n        rogue or unknown wireless Access Points (APs) and clients.\\nSecuring wireless in a CDE\\nThese are requirements mandated for systems that\\n        transmit payment card information over wireless and wired technology. In addition to\\n        generally applicable wireless requirements, they impose additional security requirements for\\n        changing default passwords and configurations, using strong encryption and authentication,\\n        regular updating of the system with compliant software, and monitoring access.\\nPCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC)\\nJuniper Mist solution has been assessed by an independent PCI DSS security assessor to meet\\n      PCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC).\\nCloud Security\\nThe Mist cloud is outside the CDE environment as it does not carry any wireless packet data.\\n      Regardless, Mist takes additional measures to ensure the highest level of security in the Mist\\n      cloud to ensure confidentiality, processing integrity, and availability.

By providing consistent and holistic security policies and best practices, PCI DSS\\n      enables security personnel and network administrators to effectively thwart various threats to\\n      payment data. PCI DSS 3.2.1 went into effect for assessments in May 2018.\\nThe network is a critical cornerstone of PCI DSS compliance as it is the primary channel for\\n      transmitting payment data. PCI DSS requirements are designed to ensure that network security\\n      operations and practices eliminate or minimize known risks. Plus, they ensure that the\\n      organization defines traceable well-structured policies, procedures, and practices that can be\\n      audited.\\nThe wireless network in particular is especially important to retail environments as business\\n      operations and digital engagement technologies rely upon mobile connectivity. Point of Sale\\n      devices, scanners, barcode readers, printers, and mobile computers, for example, all operate\\n      on Wireless LANs (WLAN) that serve as the lifeblood of retail operations. Given the importance\\n      of WLANs, there are two types of requirements specifically outlined for the PCI DSS compliance\\n      of wireless networks. These include:\\nGenerally applicable wireless\\nThese are requirements that apply even when the\\n        wireless network is not in scope of the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). They include\\n        strong network segmentation to protect the CDE network and security against attacks from\\n        rogue or unknown wireless Access Points (APs) and clients.\\nSecuring wireless in a CDE\\nThese are requirements mandated for systems that\\n        transmit payment card information over wireless and wired technology. In addition to\\n        generally applicable wireless requirements, they impose additional security requirements for\\n        changing default passwords and configurations, using strong encryption and authentication,\\n        regular updating of the system with compliant software, and monitoring access.\\nPCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC)\\nJuniper Mist solution has been assessed by an independent PCI DSS security assessor to meet\\n      PCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC).\\nCloud Security\\nThe Mist cloud is outside the CDE environment as it does not carry any wireless packet data.\\n      Regardless, Mist takes additional measures to ensure the highest level of security in the Mist\\n      cloud to ensure confidentiality, processing integrity, and availability. For example:\\nMist uses a SOC2 Type 2 / ISO 27001 / PCI cloud data\\nMaintains an information security policy.\\nUser access is highly\\nUse of network application firewalls / access control lists.\\nUse of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Protection System (IPS).\\nIndustry standard encryption is utilized at various levels.\\nAny information stored in the cloud is obfuscated with an organization-specific\\nSecurity is integrated with development cycles, and pen tests are performed to detect\\n        vulnerabilities at the network and application\\nPerform regularly scheduled internal and external vulnerability scans.\\nImplement annual security awareness training for all in-scope employees.\\nPerform an annual risk assessment of the in-scope business environment.\\nHave in place incident response plan.\\nAnnual PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC) by independent PCI DSS security\\n        assessor\\nNetwork Segmentation\\nThe following schemas can be implemented in a Mist environment to\\n      ensure network segmentation:\\nPhysical Segmentation:\\nOne way to achieve network segmentation is to connect the\\n      wireless APs on a wired network that is physically separate from the CDE network. This would\\n      imply having an overlay wired and wireless infrastructure that does not have any intersection\\n      with the wired network for the CDE environment. In this scheme, there is no firewall or\\n      internet connection that is shared between the CDE and non-CDE networks.\\nVLAN based logical segmentation:\\nIt is common to use Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment\\n      the networks into logical subnets. While it is possible to achieve logical segmentation by\\n      having the wireless network and the CDE in different VLANs, this methodology is not considered\\n      a safe and secure way to protect the network, without adequate access control policies between\\n      VLANs.\\nFirewall separation:\\nIf the wireless LAN is connected to the CDE, instituting a\\n      Firewall between the Wireless network and the CDE network is an acceptable form of\\n      segmentation that conforms to PCI DSS 3.2.1 requirements.\\nSoftware defined policy engine.\\nMist\\u2019s integrated WxLAN policy engine can be used to\\n      isolate any wireless traffic into the CDE environment. Mist delivers a powerful platform when\\n      it comes to creating policies for role, user, application, and resource-based access on the\\n      network via its inline policy engine \\u2013 WxLAN. The Mist wireless infrastructure allows policies\\n      to be enforced on any wired network with access to the LAN blocked for all WLANs configured in\\n      the system.\\nProtect Network from External Attacks\\nTo ensure the wireless network is compliant with the generally applicable requirements for\\n      PCI DSS, retailers need to pay special attention to the following:\\nRogue Devices: These are accidental or malicious AP on the wired network that can be used\\n        to violate internal networks with access to all network resources.\\nHoneypot devices: these are accidental or malicious AP that masquerade as sanctioned AP\\n        sending the retailer\\u2019s AP beacon.\\nNon-compliant and unsanctioned APs: These range for APs that may be sanctioned APs but out\\n        of compliance running old firmware without critical security Similarly, these may also\\n        include APs that are neighbors as well as those causing inadvertent interference to the\\n        wireless operations inside the four walls of a retail store or warehouse.\\nTwo activities are required for handling these external devices, often referred to as\\n      Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention (WIDS/ WIPS):\\nMonitor the RF environment to find and analyze the existence of\\nIsolate any Wi-Fi APs not used to transmit or receive cardholder\\nTraditionally there have been several ways in which WLAN vendors have addressed the above\\n      requirements for WIDS/WIPS compliance:\\nPart-time\\nIn this mode, APs when not serving clients scan the spectrum for rogue\\n        devices. This is almost akin to having a security solution that only works some of the time\\n        \\u2013 not 24\\u00d77.\\nDedicated APs\\nprovide 24\\u00d77 security monitoring of the wireless While this does\\n        protect the network all the time, it explodes the deployment cost for additional APs with\\n        associated installation cost of PoE cable runs to the IDF/MDF to power up the sensors.\\nSome vendors use dual-banded radios in APs and steal a radio within an AP for sensor\\n        implementation leading to nightmares in channel planning and insufficient coverage for\\n        clients in the\\nSome vendors, while offering a tri-radio AP solution with a dedicated third radio, deploy\\n        a complete overlay monitoring solutions orthogonal to the rest of the Wireless\\n        infrastructure and Controller solution with isolated islands of data sources, databases,\\n        visualization and even separate controls for radio configuration, control, and\\n        provisioning.\\nMist APs provide continuous 24\\u00d77 scanning of the spectrum alongside 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and 6Ghz\\n      client access. This allows Mist to continually scan the spectrum for rogues, honeypots,\\n      interference, and for anomalies such as unsuccessful connection attempts at a site (which may\\n      be a source for a DDOS attack).\\nIn addition, unlike traditional vendors, the Mist platform maintains a state machine and a\\n      baseline on key metrics for every physical device (AP, clients) and logical entity (location,\\n      site, site-groups) that complements flow information and a rich elastic cloud data store.\\n      Mist\\u2019s AI powered infrastructure identifies unusual activity at every level of the network and\\n      this way the Mist platform can detect existing and zero-day threats. In addition, Mist\\u2019s\\n      location technology can be used to accurately locate accidental or malicious rogue devices\\n      and\\nprovide location-based access to resources. Mist\\u2019s Machine Learning framework can be extended\\n      to behavioral analytics whereby client device capabilities can be checked against the \\u201cnormal\\u201d\\n      baseline and alerts generated when key postures change (e.g. a 4\\u00d74 client device appears as a\\n      2\\u00d72 device or a client device sanctioned for a California location appears to access the\\n      network from New York).\\nSecuring Wireless in the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)\\nAs mentioned above, the second set of requirements applies to wireless devices on the same\\n      network where credit card data is handled. Mist allows you to conduct a PCI scan for the VLANs\\n      and Wireless LANs in scope, and helps you remediate both the vulnerabilities on the wireless\\n      network and enforce policies on the wireless management system.\\nThe following is how Mist addresses the main requirements for these \\u201cin scope\\u201d wireless\\n      networks to be PCI DSS compliant:\\nConclusion\\nAs organizations rely more on wireless networks as a key enabler for business services, PCI\\n      DSS requires careful attention to WLAN security.\\nFortunately, Mist has you covered. By protecting wireless networks from external attack and\\n      ensuring data transferred on CDE networks is always secure, the Mist Learning WLAN is a safe\\n      choice for mission critical wireless networks in PCI environments. The key difference in the\\n      Mist architecture is how the workflows have been streamlined to enable a cohesive experience\\n      for network IT, Security Operations Teams, Marketing, and other lines of business. With Mist,\\n      access layer connectivity and associated applications is now all about delivering a\\n      comprehensive, amazing, and secure experience.\\narrow_backward\\nPREVIOUS\\nFind Wireless Client MAC Addresses\\nNEXT\\narrow_forward\\nWxLAN Access Policies [\\"[{\\\\\\"PCI DSS REQUIREMENTS V3.1 FOR WIRELESS\\\\\\":\\\\\\"1.1.2 Current network diagram that identifies all connections between the  cardholder data environment and other networks, including any wireless  networks.\\\\\\",\\\\\\"MIST CONFORMS\\\\\\":\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u221a\\\\\\",\\\\\\"MIST VALUE PROPOSITION\\\\\\":\\\\\\"Mist\\\\\\\\u2019s PCI scan report identifies the list of wireless SSIDs and APs that connect  with the CDE.\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\"PCI DSS REQUIREMENTS V3.1 FOR WIRELESS\\\\\\":\\\\\\"2.1.1 For wireless environments connected to the cardholder data environment or  transmitting cardholder data, change ALL wireless vendor defaults at installation,  including but not limited to default wireless encryption keys, passwords, and SNMP  community strings.\\\\\\",\\\\\\"MIST CONFORMS\\\\\\":\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u221a\\\\\\",\\\\\\"MIST VALUE PROPOSITION\\\\\\":\\\\\\"Mist does not have default passwords, encryption keys or SNMP community  strings.\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\"PCI DSS REQUIREMENTS V3.1 FOR WIRELESS\\\\\\":\\\\\\"2.4 Maintain an inventory of system components that are in scope for PCI DSS.

By providing consistent and holistic security policies and best practices, PCI DSS\\n      enables security personnel and network administrators to effectively thwart various threats to\\n      payment data. PCI DSS 3.2.1 went into effect for assessments in May 2018.\\nThe network is a critical cornerstone of PCI DSS compliance as it is the primary channel for\\n      transmitting payment data. PCI DSS requirements are designed to ensure that network security\\n      operations and practices eliminate or minimize known risks. Plus, they ensure that the\\n      organization defines traceable well-structured policies, procedures, and practices that can be\\n      audited.\\nThe wireless network in particular is especially important to retail environments as business\\n      operations and digital engagement technologies rely upon mobile connectivity. Point of Sale\\n      devices, scanners, barcode readers, printers, and mobile computers, for example, all operate\\n      on Wireless LANs (WLAN) that serve as the lifeblood of retail operations. Given the importance\\n      of WLANs, there are two types of requirements specifically outlined for the PCI DSS compliance\\n      of wireless networks. These include:\\nGenerally applicable wireless\\nThese are requirements that apply even when the\\n        wireless network is not in scope of the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). They include\\n        strong network segmentation to protect the CDE network and security against attacks from\\n        rogue or unknown wireless Access Points (APs) and clients.\\nSecuring wireless in a CDE\\nThese are requirements mandated for systems that\\n        transmit payment card information over wireless and wired technology. In addition to\\n        generally applicable wireless requirements, they impose additional security requirements for\\n        changing default passwords and configurations, using strong encryption and authentication,\\n        regular updating of the system with compliant software, and monitoring access.\\nPCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC)\\nJuniper Mist solution has been assessed by an independent PCI DSS security assessor to meet\\n      PCI DSS 3.2.1 Attestation of Compliance (AOC).\\nCloud Security\\nThe Mist cloud is outside the CDE environment as it does not carry any wireless packet data.\\n      Regardless, Mist takes additional measures to ensure the highest level of security in the Mist\\n      cloud to ensure confidentiality, processing integrity, and availability. For example:\\nMist uses a SOC2 Type 2 / ISO 27001 / PCI cloud data\\nMaintains an information security policy.\\nUser access is highly\\nUse of network application firewalls / access control lists.\\nUse of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Protection System (IPS).\\nIndustry standard encryption is utilized at various levels.\\nAny information stored in the cloud is obfuscated with an organization-specific\\nSecurity is integrated with development cycles, and pen tests are performed to detect\\n        vulnerabilities at the network and application\\nPerform regularly scheduled internal and external vulnerability scans.\\nImplement annual security awareness training for all in-scope employees.\\nPerform an annual risk assessment of the in-scope business environment.\\nHave in place incident response plan.\\nAnnual PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC) by independent PCI DSS security\\n        assessor\\nNetwork Segmentation\\nThe following schemas can be implemented in a Mist environment to\\n      ensure network segmentation:\\nPhysical Segmentation:\\nOne way to achieve network segmentation is to connect the\\n      wireless APs on a wired network that is physically separate from the CDE network. This would\\n      imply having an overlay wired and wireless infrastructure that does not have any intersection\\n      with the wired network for the CDE environment. In this scheme, there is no firewall or\\n      internet connection that is shared between the CDE and non-CDE networks.\\nVLAN based logical segmentation:\\nIt is common to use Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment\\n      the networks into logical subnets. While it is possible to achieve logical segmentation by\\n      having the wireless network and the CDE in different VLANs, this methodology is not considered\\n      a safe and secure way to protect the network, without adequate access control policies between\\n      VLANs.\\nFirewall separation:\\nIf the wireless LAN is connected to the CDE, instituting a\\n      Firewall between the Wireless network and the CDE network is an acceptable form of\\n      segmentation that conforms to PCI DSS 3.2.1 requirements.\\nSoftware defined policy engine.\\nMist\\u2019s integrated WxLAN policy engine can be used to\\n      isolate any wireless traffic into the CDE environment. Mist delivers a powerful platform when\\n      it comes to creating policies for role, user, application, and resource-based access on the\\n      network via its inline policy engine \\u2013 WxLAN. The Mist wireless infrastructure allows policies\\n      to be enforced on any wired network with access to the LAN blocked for all WLANs configured in\\n      the system.\\nProtect Network from External Attacks\\nTo ensure the wireless network is compliant with the generally applicable requirements for\\n      PCI DSS, retailers need to pay special attention to the following:\\nRogue Devices: These are accidental or malicious AP on the wired network that can be used\\n        to violate internal networks with access to all network resources.\\nHoneypot devices: these are accidental or malicious AP that masquerade as sanctioned AP\\n        sending the retailer\\u2019s AP beacon.\\nNon-compliant and unsanctioned APs: These range for APs that may be sanctioned APs but out\\n        of compliance running old firmware without critical security Similarly, these may also\\n        include APs that are neighbors as well as those causing inadvertent interference to the\\n        wireless operations inside the four walls of a retail store or warehouse.\\nTwo activities are required for handling these external devices, often referred to as\\n      Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention (WIDS/ WIPS):\\nMonitor the RF environment to find and analyze the existence of\\nIsolate any Wi-Fi APs not used to transmit or receive cardholder\\nTraditionally there have been several ways in which WLAN vendors have addressed the above\\n      requirements for WIDS/WIPS compliance:\\nPart-time\\nIn this mode, APs when not serving clients scan the spectrum for rogue\\n        devices. This is almost akin to having a security solution that only works some of the time\\n        \\u2013 not 24\\u00d77.\\nDedicated APs\\nprovide 24\\u00d77 security monitoring of the wireless While this does\\n        protect the network all the time, it explodes the deployment cost for additional APs with\\n        associated installation cost of PoE cable runs to the IDF/MDF to power up the sensors.\\nSome vendors use dual-banded radios in APs and steal a radio within an AP for sensor\\n        implementation leading to nightmares in channel planning and insufficient coverage for\\n        clients in the\\nSome vendors, while offering a tri-radio AP solution with a dedicated third radio, deploy\\n        a complete overlay monitoring solutions orthogonal to the rest of the Wireless\\n        infrastructure and Controller solution with isolated islands of data sources, databases,\\n        visualization and even separate controls for radio configuration, control, and\\n        provisioning.\\nMist APs provide continuous 24\\u00d77 scanning of the spectrum alongside 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and 6Ghz\\n      client access. This allows Mist to continually scan the spectrum for rogues, honeypots,\\n      interference, and for anomalies such as unsuccessful connection attempts at a site (which may\\n      be a source for a DDOS attack).\\nIn addition, unlike traditional vendors, the Mist platform maintains a state machine and a\\n      baseline on key metrics for every physical device (AP, clients) and logical entity (location,\\n      site, site-groups) that complements flow information and a rich elastic cloud data store.\\n      Mist\\u2019s AI powered infrastructure identifies unusual activity at every level of the network and\\n      this way the Mist platform can detect existing and zero-day threats. In addition, Mist\\u2019s\\n      location technology can be used to accurately locate accidental or malicious rogue devices\\n      and\\nprovide location-based access to resources. Mist\\u2019s Machine Learning framework can be extended\\n      to behavioral analytics whereby client device capabilities can be checked against the \\u201cnormal\\u201d\\n      baseline and alerts generated when key postures change (e.g. a 4\\u00d74 client device appears as a\\n      2\\u00d72 device or a client device sanctioned for a California location appears to access the\\n      network from New York).\\nSecuring Wireless in the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)\\nAs mentioned above, the second set of requirements applies to wireless devices on the same\\n      network where credit card data is handled. Mist allows you to conduct a PCI scan for the VLANs\\n      and Wireless LANs in scope, and helps you remediate both the vulnerabilities on the wireless\\n      network and enforce policies on the wireless management system.\\nThe following is how Mist addresses the main requirements for these \\u201cin scope\\u201d wireless\\n      networks to be PCI DSS compliant:\\nConclusion\\nAs organizations rely more on wireless networks as a key enabler for business services, PCI\\n      DSS requires careful attention to WLAN security.\\nFortunately, Mist has you covered. By protecting wireless networks from external attack and\\n      ensuring data transferred on CDE networks is always secure, the Mist Learning WLAN is a safe\\n      choice for mission critical wireless networks in PCI environments. The key difference in the\\n      Mist architecture is how the workflows have been streamlined to enable a cohesive experience\\n      for network IT, Security Operations Teams, Marketing, and other lines of business. With Mist,\\n      access layer connectivity and associated applications is now all about delivering a\\n      comprehensive, amazing, and secure experience.\\narrow_backward\\nPREVIOUS\\nFind Wireless Client MAC Addresses\\nNEXT\\narrow_forward\\nWxLAN Access Policies", "model_id": ".elser_model_2_linux-x86_64", "title": "PCI DSS Compliance | Mist | Juniper Networks", "chunk_text": "audited.\\nThe wireless network in particular is especially important to retail environments as business\\n      operations and digital engagement technologies rely upon mobile connectivity.
